# BulletJournal
Manage your life, be efficient, be productive! 
# intro
BulletJournal is a ruby web app that implements the bullet journal system : http://bulletjournal.com/
you can setup your journal in a local computer and access it everywhere.
the system uses a sqlite3 database wich is easy to install , manage and backup. But you can easily hack it to use a more "production" sql server like mysql or postgresql.
# depencencies
BulletJournal uses sqlite3 so it needs sqlite3 and the gem "sqlite3". Eventualy it would need sinatra.
